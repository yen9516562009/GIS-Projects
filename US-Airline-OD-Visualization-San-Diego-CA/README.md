# 2015 US Airline Origin-Destination (OD) Visualization - San Diego
This project explores the utility of [kepler](https://kepler.gl/demo), a powerful open-source geospatial analysis tool for large-scale data sets.
An interactive Arc layer visuzlizes the US OD pairs with passenger miles in San Diego, acquired from [US Airline Route Segments 2015] (https://data.world/garyhoov/us-airline-route-segments-2015).
Arc layers draw an arc between two points. The tallest arc represents the greatest distance. The thicker arc stands for higher passenger miles.
